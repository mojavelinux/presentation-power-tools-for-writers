Coding and writing are alike in many ways.
They're both forged by carefully weaving structure and creativity.
Both go through many revisions on the journey towards quality.

As developers, you use tools to code like a demigod.
Writers deserve awesome tools too.
We'll tap into the Asciidoctor ecosystem and show you many of the awesome tools that are available to you.

* Effective collaboration using git and GitHub
* Instant Preview using browser extensions
